# Always attempt new things. Who knows what you'll discover?

Howdy Y'all! Alex Fischer here. I'm a collage student at CPTC for Computer Programming. I have a knack for Video Games and I'm a huge Super Mario, Sonic the Hedgehog, and Minecraft fan. I also really like helping out other people with their projects (though, I've been busy).

I have some experience with coding languages and tools. I'm really good at HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, and have been learning a lot about Python, C#, .NET, and ASP.NET (following the MVC pattern). I'm decent at using command prompt tools.

I'm good with libraries like Three.js and [GB Studio](https://github.com/chrismaltby/gb-studio ).

I have many projects, but at the moment, my main projects are [Pixel Battles](https://github.com/SuperGamer001/PixelBattles), my very own Game Library App (Something like EA, but more like you got to "play to play" kind of thing ðŸ˜†), and Sonic the Hedgehog game.

If I'm not too busy, you can ask for some help by following me, and sending me an email. I'd love to help you out!

## Team Projects:
- [Pokedex](https://github.com/CPTC-Team-3/Pokedex): A very small C# Winforms pokemon game.
- [GameBox](https://github.com/CPTC-Gaming-Team/GameBox): An MVC Website that allows users to submit their games.
- [Adopt A Monster](https://github.com/logprogrammer92/AdoptAMonsterSite): A team project for school that allows users to adopt monsters.
