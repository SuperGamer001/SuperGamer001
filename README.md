Always attempt new things. Who knows what you'll discover?

Hello! My name is Alex, and I'm a collage student at CPTC for Computer Programming. I absolutly love Video Games. I'm a huge Super Mario, Sonic the Hedgehog, and Minecraft fan.

I'm good at HTML and JavaScript, and battle with CSS quite often when it comes to sizing. I'm learning Java and Python. I'm good at using npm tools and Three.js. I'm also learing a little bit about [GB Studio](https://github.com/chrismaltby/gb-studio )

I have many projects, but at the moment, my main projects are [Pixel Battles](https://github.com/SuperGamer001/PixelBattles), [Sonic Runners](https://github.com/PlopesK/Sonic-R), and my very own Game Library App (Something like EA, but more like you got to play to play kind of thing ðŸ˜†)

I'm always trying to help someone out with their projects, because helping people with things brings me joy.
