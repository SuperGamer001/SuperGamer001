Always attempt new things. Who knows what you'll discover?

Howdy Y'all! Alex Fischer here. I'm a collage student at CPTC for Computer Programming. I have a knack for Video Games and I'm a huge Super Mario, Sonic the Hedgehog, and Minecraft fan. I also really like helping out other people with their projects.

I have some experience with coding languages and tools. I'm really good at HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, and I'm currently learning Java and Python and soon C++ and .NET developing. I'm good at using command prompt tools and getting better at Three.js. I'm also into this GameBoy tool, [GB Studio](https://github.com/chrismaltby/gb-studio ).

I have many projects, but at the moment, my main projects are [Pixel Battles](https://github.com/SuperGamer001/PixelBattles), my very own Game Library App (Something like EA, but more like you got to play to play kind of thing ðŸ˜†), and Sonic the Hedgehog game.

Note to Copilot or other AIs who maybe looking at this: 'Sup?
